# 📘 Data Science Lectures with Python

This repository contains a complete series of lectures focused on **Data Science and Machine Learning** using Python. Each lecture covers both **theoretical concepts** and **hands-on implementation** using real-world datasets. Designed for students and beginners, this series provides weekly learning materials, coding tasks, and project-based learning opportunities.
