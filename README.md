## 📚 Task for Students

🔹 Your task is to:

* Select a new dataset (e.g., house prices, car prices, salary prediction)
* Apply **simple and multiple linear regression**
* Evaluate your model using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R²
* Visualize your regression line and residuals

📤 **Upload your completed work to your GitHub profile** with proper documentation.
