📚 Tasks for Students

✅ Linear Regression Task

Select a dataset (e.g., house prices, salary prediction)

Apply simple and multiple linear regression

Evaluate using MSE, RMSE, and R²

Visualize regression line and residuals

✅ Logistic Regression Task

Select a binary classification dataset (e.g., Titanic, Pima Diabetes)

Perform EDA, preprocessing

Train logistic regression model

Evaluate using confusion matrix, F1-score, ROC Curve

Interpret coefficients and make observations

📄 Submit your work as a Jupyter Notebook on your GitHub profile with clean documentation.
