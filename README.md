# 📘 Data Science Lectures with Python

This repository contains a complete series of lectures focused on **Data Science and Machine Learning** using Python. Each lecture covers both **theoretical concepts** and **hands-on implementation** using real-world datasets. Designed for students and beginners, this series provides weekly learning materials, coding tasks, and project-based learning opportunities.

* Visualize results and explain findings

### Logistic Regression Task

* Choose a binary classification dataset (e.g., Titanic, Pima Diabetes)
* Perform EDA, preprocess, and train logistic regression model
* Evaluate using classification metrics & ROC Curve
* Interpret model coefficients

### SVM Task

* Use a binary classification dataset (e.g., Heart Disease)
* Compare linear vs. RBF SVM models
* Apply GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluate with confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score
